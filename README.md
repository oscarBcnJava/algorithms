# algorithms

All algorithms are from the book:
`Algorithms, 4th Edition
Copyright © 2000–2016 Robert Sedgewick and Kevin Wayne. All rights reserved.`

Code uses maven version 3 (compiles in java 8)

#Source Code
It should be easy to download locally code with (assuming Git is installed):
`https://github.com/oscarBcnJava/algorithms.git`
At that point, you could import it with your IDE as a Maven project.


Any improve, fix, idea or algorithm is welcome! :)
